# Oystercard 

This repo seeks to emulate how an oystercard functions, in the context of touching in and out of stations. It calculates zone fare, penalties for not touching in nor out, and stores a balance.

# Motivation

Application of previous week's concepts; greater focus on mocking objects during testing.

# Skills demonstrated
- Using mock objects in tests to isolate the tested class
- Greater use of SRP
- Using boolean flag in an object for certain complex conditions
- Effectively using private methods where necessary
- Using dup object copies as return values to prevent manipulation
- Dependency injection in initialization

# Comments

Creating and thinking about how to tackle the penalty situations were very fun
